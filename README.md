# Predicting defaults on student loans
This is a CS3244 Machine Learning project that aims to predict the median earnings and future repayment rates of a given student. This is achieved by using a Gradient Boosting Regressor with a Regression Chain to model the College Scorecard dataset (a subset of it). This information can then be easily used (with a mathematical formula) to determine whether or not the student will default on their loan (binary classification, it does not give the likelihood). 

You can find the project report [here](https://github.com/amrut-prabhu/loan-default-prediction/blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf) and the poster [here](https://github.com/amrut-prabhu/loan-default-prediction/blob/master/CS3244%20Poster.pdf). [Here](https://youtu.be/3Ozx1v0Pwe4) is a short video describing the importance and a high level overview of the project.
