# Predicting defaults on student loans
This is a Machine Learning project that aims to predict the median earnings and future repayment rates of a given student (which can be used to predict defaults). This is achieved by using a Gradient Boosting Regressor with a Regression Chain to model the College Scorecard dataset (a subset of it). This information can then be easily used (with a mathematical formula) to determine whether or not the student will default on their loan (binary classification, it does not give the likelihood). We achieved an accuracy of up to 91.39% on the entire dataset and 85.73% on the test set.
